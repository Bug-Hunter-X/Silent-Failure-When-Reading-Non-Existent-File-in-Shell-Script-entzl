This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in shell scripting: silently failing when attempting to read a non-existent file using input redirection. The `bug.sh` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  The issue arises from the lack of explicit error checking; if the file specified by  `file_to_read` is missing, the script won't report an error, leading to potentially unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates how to check file existence using `-f` before processing.
