#!/bin/bash

# This script attempts to read a file and print its contents.
# However, it contains a subtle error that can cause unexpected behavior.

file_to_read="my_file.txt"

# Attempt to read the file using input redirection
while IFS= read -r line; do
  echo "$line"
done < "$file_to_read"

# The error is that if my_file.txt does not exist, the script will fail silently.
# A better approach would be to check for the file's existence before attempting to read it.

#Here is an example of an improved script:

if [ -f "$file_to_read" ]; then
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "$line"
  done < "$file_to_read"
else
  echo "Error: File '$file_to_read' not found."
